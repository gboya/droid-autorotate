droid-autorotate
================

No orientation sensor on your external monitor? Then, just strap your Android phone on it to enable auto-rotation!

This project is two simple applications : an Android App and a Windows App that communicate with each other over Wifi network.

Windows App
-------------

* The Windows application handles external monitor configuration thru the [MultiMonitorHelper Library](https://multimonitorhelper.codeplex.com/), which wraps all the P/Invoke calls with a more friendly API.
